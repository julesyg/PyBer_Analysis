# PYBER ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS

The goal of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data data by city type, as well as a line graph that shows the weekly fare totals by city type as well. 

## RESULTS

As indicated in the DataFrame below, we can see there is a great disparity between the totals of every column between city types. Urban cities have the largest total fares, drivers and counts but have the lowest average fare per ride and driver. The data on Rural cities shows the contrary with the lowest total fares, drivers and counts but with the highest average fare per ride and drivers. Drivers in Rural cities earn an average of $55.49 per fare vs Urban drivers who earn an average fare of $16.57. Data on Suburban cities shows total drivers and ride counts much lower than Urban cities but the total fares, average fare per ride and driver were closer to Rural cities.

Weekly fares were plotted to ascertain which city type garnered the highest total fares.
